## What is Neutralinojs?

Neutralinojs is a lightweight and portable application development framework. It lets you develop cross-platform applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Neutralinojs applications will work on Linux, Windows, macOS, and Web.

## Why Neutralinojs?

In Electron and NW.js you have to install NodeJS and hundreds of dependency libraries. 
Embedded Chromium and Node make even simple apps bloaty. 
Neutralino offers a lightweight and portable SDK which is an alternative for Electron and NW.js. 
Neutralinojs implements a RESTful API for native operations, and it embeds a static web server to serve the web content. Also, it offers a built-in JavaScript client library for developers.
