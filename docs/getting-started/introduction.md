## What is Neutralinojs?

Neutralinojs is a lightweight and portable application development framework. It lets you develop cross-platform applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Neutralinojs applications will work on Linux, Windows, macOS, and Web.

## Why Neutralinojs?

In Electron and NW.js you have to install NodeJS and hundreds of dependency libraries. Embedded Chromium and Node make even simple apps bloaty. Neutralino offers a lightweight and portable SDK which is an alternative for Electron and NW.js also with many advantages.
