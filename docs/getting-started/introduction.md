## What is Neutralinojs?

Neutralinojs is a lightweight and portable application development framework. It lets you develop cross-platform applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Neutralinojs applications will work on Linux, Windows, macOs, and Web.

## Why Neutralinojs? 

In Electron and NWjs you have to install NodeJs and hundreds of dependency libraries. Embedded Chromium and Node make even simple apps bloaty. Neutralino offers a lightweight and portable SDK which is an alternative for Electron and NW.js also with many advantages.

See performance comparison: [Neutralinojs vs Electron vs NW.js (2018)](https://github.com/neutralinojs/evaluation)

- No additional dependencies required for users.
